# aector
This library provides an implementation of the actor model. The goal of this library is to enable users to create actors, which can dynamically change their behavior during runtime. This is achieved by internally working with trait objects and the Any trait. Further a testing framework is supplied which can be used to generate test actors in an easy and type-safe way. 

For examples check out the provided examples and read the documentation which can be found at [https://docs.rs/aector](https://docs.rs/aector).
